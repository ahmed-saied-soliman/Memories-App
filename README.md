## Introduction

Using React, Node.js, Express & MongoDB I have implemented a Full Stack MERN Application - from start to finish.
The App is called "Memories" and it is a simple social media app that allows users to post interesting events that happened in their lives.

### What I have Learned through building this app :
- how to connect frontend and backend through API
- authorization using google auth and JWT 
- using redux,thunk,reducers,actions & global state

Setup:
- run ```npm i && npm start``` for both client and server side to start the app
